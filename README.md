## no-name-yet

As for now, i have no f\*\*king idea on what to name the project

I am really lazy to write README.md. For now i will add following line:

    This project is inspired from cardon.now.sh and samantha ming's tidbits

and of course, some screenshots

<img src="public/images/card1.png" width="600" />
<img src="public/images/card2.png" width="600" />
<img src="public/images/card3.png" width="600" />

#### Todo

- [ ] Reset colors functionality
- [ ] Add placeholder text for content and code editors
- [ ] Add way to increase padding of card (vertically and horizontally)
- [ ] Funtionality to add/remove footer (may be header) for any template
- [ ] Multiple font support (both content/editor)
- [ ] Should we switch to monaco-editor ??????
- [ ] Add names for templates
- [ ] What about facebook share ??
- [ ] For f\*\*k sake, we need emoji support first
